		"content": "I met Nikhil during the Global Entrepreneurship Summer School (GESS) at the Tongji University in Shanghai, China. Nikhil and I were not only roommates, but also team members. Together we worked on one of the worlds biggest environmental problems: consumption. With the subtopic waste, we focused on abandoning plastic in the usage of food delivery packaging. Our team of five members found a sustainable and scalable way to solve not only that problem, but also to reduce the overall leftover waste by 25%!!! The business model that we built was profitable and would change the food delivery experience of every single user. Nikhil did not only strongly commit into our team work with his broad knowledge about the market and many start-ups, he did also pitch our ideas to investors in the most professional way. All of our team members appreciated the work with Nikhil. During our last days, we had to work almost 20 hours a day in order to finish our pitch. With Nikhil being one of the first team members to come and one of the last members to leave, I know that working over time will never be a problem for him. He focused on delivering the best presentation as possible on time, for which I am very thankful.  I want to use this opportunity to thank Nikhil. With him I did not only met a professional serial entrepreneur with a knowledge from start-ups to various markets, but also won a very good friend. I highly recommend Nikhil to every possible position."

			"description": "The Methane Hydrate monitoring station consists of three types of observing systems: geochemical, microbial and seismo-acoustic. Hydrate occurs within sediments. The high resolution seismo-acoustics allows to recognize the gas-charged sediments beneath the seabed through several intra-sedimentary acoustic features. It reveals the characteristic of the \"gassy\" intra-sedimentary features which cannot be seen in the low resolution seismic reflection record.  Seismo-acoustic method is employed to methane hydrate and oil reservoir detection and characterization. Methane hydrate (white gold) is a crystal fuel which releases 164 unit volume of methane gas from one unit volume of gas hydrate. Hydrate dissociation could be critical in inciting slope failures for low permeability sediments in shallow water depths. Since gas hydrates are located on the continental slope and \u2013 if present in sufficient amounts \u2013 may increase sediment strength, their dissociation influences slope stability.Gas hydrates and submarine slope stability, exploring the role of gas hydrates in triggering and/or propagating submarine mass movements is pertinent task before geo-scientist. Biochemical reveals the impact of the stability, structure, and gas composition of the gas hydrate. In fact, methano genesis is indirectly involved in the formation of a highly abundant form of gas hydrates on earth- biogenic methane hydrate. Biochemical reaction and diffusion in seafloor gas hydrate capillaries affects the gas hydrate stability. Biochemical reactions occur within gas hydrate accumulations providing a driving force for diffusion of organic and inorganic components in and out of gas hydrate interior. Study of GHSZ shows transport phenomenon which affects the gas hydrate stability in multiple ways, depending on the biochemical reactions occurring. Seismic imaging by wavelet transform provides precise cause of slope stability"

Res., 25(4), 217-225 (2015) http://ser.cienve.org.tw/ KEY WORDS 3D modelling, hydraulic fractures, shale, COMSOL Multiphysics  ABSTRACT  The modeling of conjugate development of fractures and fluid flow remains a significant subject in a diversity of rock engineering. Continuum numerical methods are paramount in the modeling of rock engineering practice problems, merely with restrained capacities in modeling the problem of fracture development coupled by fluid flow. There exists a demand for them to be understood in details. Driven by this, we demonstrated an approach based on a three-dimensional development of fracture of an abstract model condensed to two-dimensional analysis comprising rocks with fractures. In the framework of a continuum method of modeling, the contact between the fracture development and deformation was paired with fluid flow. A 3-D model was established in this case for a shale reservoir and fluid was injected at multiple pressures to understand the initiation and propagation of fractures, as applied to the field of hydraulic fracturing. The stress, strain, displacement in the reservoir were monitored at multiple injection pressures. Linear relations of injection pressures were observed with these parameters. A detailed insight with quantification of the values is given into the subject based on the findings of this study."

Shale gas is natural gas from shale formations which acts as both the source and the reservoir for the natural gas. Each Shale gas reservoir has unique characteristics. Shale has low matrix permeability, so gas production in commercial quantities requires fractures to provide permeability. For a given matrix permeability and pressure, gas production are determined by the number and complexity of fractures created, their effective conductivity, and the ability to effectively reduce the pressure throughout the fracture network to initiate gas production. Understanding the relationship between fracture complexity, fracture conductivity, matrix permeability, and gas recovery is a fundamental challenge of shale-gas development. Shale gas reservoirs almost always have two different storage volumes (dual porosity) for hydrocarbons, the rock matrix and the natural fractures ."
